Notes:
------
We made a little change to project 2: MySQL was treating the backslash character (\) as an escape sequence rather than the standard double quote (""). About four lines were added to project 2's import script to make the MySQL import work correctly for csv outputted by our Java class.

Nothing was changed in Part 3A since the indexes worked fine.
